# RisingTide
The objective of the game is to tap the screen to bounce a ball away from a rising tide. The player jumps and lands on increasingly fast moving platforms to progress. Using GameKit I was able to provide leaderboards and achievements linked to player's Apple ID.   The game was written in Swift 3.0 using SpriteKit and uses the now defunct Parse for data analytics.
